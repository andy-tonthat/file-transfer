Once you have cloned the directory, remove the `.gitkeep` file from the send directory.

To send files, copy any file or folder into the `send` directory. Nested subdirectories are able to be sent.

To receive files, you must run set_server_ip.py first. Ask the recipient for their ip address. Your received files will be in a newly created directory called `receive`.

Easy method for finding out your own IP Address:
On Windows, open a command terminal and input `ipconfig`. Read copy the output that is listed for IPv4.
